# StarCraft II MacOS Timer

This simple script keeps beeping in the background in order to remind you to do
other stuff than looking at your Zerglings moving.

## How to install

Open it in Apple Script Editor and save it as an Application and select "Stay
open after run handler". After that, you can simply double click it before starting StarCraft.

## Beeping schedule

1. Every 5 seconds you will hear a little beep. This means that you should
   switch to doing something else in the game i.e. build an SCV or check if all
   OK with your fighting army.
2. Every 30 seconds you will hear 2 beeps. This means that you should check if you are on top of your supply - you don't want to be supply blocked right?
3. Every 120 seconds you will hear 4 beeps. This means that you should send a unit to scout on what your enemy is doing.

It is quite simple, but helped me improve my game a lot.
